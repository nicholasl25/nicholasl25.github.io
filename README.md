<p align="left">âœ¨ Creating bugs since: 2018 <br>
  ðŸ“š I'm currently learning: Algorithms <br> 
  ðŸ§  One thing you should know about me: I love to be challenged<br>
  ðŸŽ¯ One goal of mine: To put my love of applied math to use <br>
  ðŸŽ² Fun fact: African lions catch about 20% of the prey they chase. Dragonflies catch 95%.</p>

<p align="left">My name is Nicholas Lombardo and I am a computer science and mathematics student at Cornell University. Iâ€™m passionate about data analytics and thrive tackling complex problems. My focus is on machine learning and time series forecasting, and Iâ€™m currently working with the Port Authority to predict airport passenger volumes using advanced models like SARIMAX and GARCH. I am also involved in my schools GeoData project team where I was tasked with using machine learning to predict Harmful Algal Blooms (HABS) in the Cayuga Lake region. 
  
The language I am most familiar with is Python, including libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Additionally, I am confident in Object Oriented Programming in Java and OCaml with a focus on functional programming.

Outside of programming, I have a deep passion for mathematics, with a strong background in areas like linear algebra, group theory, probability, and statistics. I am excited by the prospect of applying these concepts in my career.

In my free time, I enjoy playing golf and working out. Golf allows me to unwind and challenge myself in a different way, while working out helps me stay fit and energized. Both activities are a great balance to my academic and professional pursuits.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!
